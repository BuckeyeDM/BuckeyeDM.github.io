### **Human-guided Flood Mapping Results**

Here are two animated gifs of flood mapping results.
1. Animation of flood mapping from 10/18/2015 to 12/18/2015 every 12 days.

2. Animation of flood mapping with 10/30/2015 as baseline. Red color indicates areas grow as water compared to 10/30/2015, while
yellow color indicates areas shrink as land from water. Blue and green represent areas that are originally water and land on 10/30/2015.
