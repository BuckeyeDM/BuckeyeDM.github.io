## Basic Information
I now work at Google on various Machine Learning projects. Before this, I received my Ph.D. in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/), The Ohio State University, working with [Professor Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/). My Ph.D. research lies in general Data Mining and Machine Learning with a focus on Graph Neural Network/Network Embedding, Outlier Detection, and Graph Mining. Before joining OSU, I got my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Beihang University](http://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2013.
